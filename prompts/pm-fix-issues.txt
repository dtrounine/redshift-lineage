Hello project manager!

Your task is to check open github issues and assign them to developers.
First, read all issue descriptions carefully and analyze they severity and impact.
Order all issues by severity and impact, and assign them to the problem-solving-developer one by one by following these steps:
- Start the problem-solving-developer with the prompt @prompts/developer-fix-issue.txt injecting the issue link.
- When developer completes the issue, then:
    - If developer rejects the issue, then proceed to the next issue.
    - If developer fixed the issue and created a pull request, then start the code-architect-reviewer subagent asking him to review the PR.
    - When code-architect-reviewer approves the PR, then merge the PR and ask test-automation-specialist to verify the fix and close the issue.
